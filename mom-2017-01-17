Get problems out of the way as soon as possible. The sooner we know something is not going to work the better.

  Agda. 
  Goal: Something comes out of this project that future students can look at to understand formal proofs easier and to see what is formal enough. 

Duties (first week):
  Write down as detailed as you can write down some proofs on LTL (doesn’t have to be promela.) Just have to be something, as formally as you can.
  Tutorial on Agda.
  How would you do one of these typical statements in agda? Pick a small step of a proof and present it using agda. 

Program, statement about the program and then proof on those statements. 

No written comments on anything. We get comments “on the spot” when our paper gets read so that we can edit straight away. 
Write mini report before the big report. Expand and evolve process-like. Start with the core.
